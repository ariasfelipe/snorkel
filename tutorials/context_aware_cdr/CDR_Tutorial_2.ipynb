    "As mentioned above, we want to include the dependencies between our LFs when training the generative model. Snorkel makes it easy to do this! `DependencySelector` runs a fast structure learning algorithm over the matrix of LF outputs to identify a set of likely dependencies. We can see that these match up with our prior knowledge. For example, it identified a \"reinforcing\" dependency between `LF_c_induced_d` and `LF_ctd_marker_induce`. Recall that we constructed the latter using the former."
